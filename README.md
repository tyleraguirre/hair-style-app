## HairStyleApp

This project uses: Room Database, MVVM design architecture, Binding, Google Firebase

This Haircut app is meant to show users the current trending haircuts and help them make a decision on the next style to choose at their next haircut.

This app uses webviews to help display the data to the users easier such as hair images as well as a page that shows the history of the hairstyle and how
it came about.

The app allows users to also save a style to their favorites page if they end up liking the style to be able to find easier for future use.

The map fragment button launches a intent to navigate/open google maps to allow the users to search for local barbers or shops to schedule their next
haircut at.

There is commented out code in this app that was originally being used to access a FireBase Database I created to use to bring in info but began to 
function not how it should and how to work around it to have a Minimum Viable Product to show.
